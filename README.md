# Duck Facts

An app for the Tildagon badge (the badge of Electromagnetic Field 2024 onwards).

Some facts about ducks. Inspired by [@emfducks](https://mastodon.social/@emfducks) (but not endorsed by them)

Data from the [duck facts API](https://03vpefsitf.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod/)

Wants to be on wifi to grab facts.

This app has nothing to do with the following image.
