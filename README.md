# Duck Facts

An app for the [Tildagon](tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org) badge (the badge of Electromagnetic Field 2024 onwards).

Some facts about ducks ðŸ¦†
Inspired by [@emfducks](https://mastodon.social/@emfducks) (but not endorsed by them).

Data from the [duck facts API](https://03vpefsitf.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod/) (thank you to whoever is still running this!).

Wants to be on wifi to grab facts.

- TODO: make it look nicer
  - icons and images
  - figure out text colour and font stuff, currently seemingly not working
- TODO: add functional scroll
- TODO: get latest @emfducks news
- TODO: duck detector
- TODO: make it QUACK...

This app has nothing to do with the following image (but, a fully-functional duck #hexpansion must clearly be created before 2026).
